# Andrej Karpathy's Micrograd

A tiny Autograd engine. Implements backpropagation (reverse-mode autodiff) over a dynamically built DAG and a small neural networks library on top of it with a PyTorch-like API.

Built step-by-step following Andrej's excellent [explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&pp=ygUPYW5kcmVqIGthcnBhdGh5) of back propagation for hands-on learning.
